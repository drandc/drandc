# Executive Summary

**Research question.**
How efficiently do Rwanda, South Africa and Sweden translate health spending into improved population health outcomes from 2005 to 2020, and do any trends emerge during this period?

**Headlines**
- Rwanda and South Africa recorded large gains in life expectancy and sharp declines in infant mortality. The year-to-year correlation of spending with outcomes was mixed, which suggests lags, external shocks, or allocation frictions.
- Sweden invested steadily at high levels. The outcomes remained stable and marginal spending shifts had little measurable impact.
- Efficiency results vary by metric. Rwanda shows strong efficiency for life expectancy gains relative to spending growth. South Africa shows modest infant mortality efficiency but weaker efficiency for life expectancy. Sweden shows near-zero movement, in line with diminishing returns in mature systems.

# Data and Methods

**Data** (World Bank indicators, 2005–2020)
- Health expenditure as share of GDP (percent)
- Current health expenditure per capita (current US dollars)
- Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)
- Life expectancy at birth (years)

**Countries:** Rwanda, South Africa, Sweden

**Approach**
- Trend analysis for spending and outcomes for each country.
- Correlations between annual changes in spending and annual changes in outcomes (specifically, Pearson correlations for year-over-year percentage changes).
- An efficiency index showing improvement per unit of additional spending, with signs adjusted so higher values mean better outcomes. Counterintuitive results are noted and explained.

# Findings

## 1. Spending Trends (2005–2020)

**Health expenditure as percent of GDP**
- Sweden rose from about 8 percent in 2005 to 11.3 percent in 2020. Steady upward trend.
- South Africa increased from approximately 6.9 percent to 9.0 percent by 2020.
- Rwanda peaked around 8.1 percent in 2012 before declining to about 6.3 percent by 2019.

**Per capita health expenditure, average annual growth**
- Rwanda: about +6.3 percent per year.
- Sweden: about +4.3 percent per year.
- South Africa: about +2.1 percent per year.

**Interpretation:**
Rwanda's early acceleration did not fully persist, which is consistent with donor-cycle effects. South Africa increased gradually, with the GDP share rising faster than per capita spend in some years. Sweden shows sustained, high-level investment.

## 2. Outcome Trends (2005–2020)

**Infant mortality (per 1,000 live births)**
- Rwanda fell from about 64 to about 31 (about 52 percent improvement).
- South Africa fell from about 48 to about 27 (about 44 percent improvement).
- Sweden remained near 2 to 3, with minimal variation at an already low level.

**Life expectancy (years)**
- Rwanda rose from about 57 to about 67 (about +10 years).
- South Africa increased from about 54 to about 65 (about +11 years).
- Sweden remained around 81 to 82.

**Interpretation:**
Rwanda and South Africa achieved substantial improvements. South Africa's gains accelerated after 2010, consistent with expanded access to HIV treatment and broader public health measures. Sweden remained a high-performance baseline with little room for year-to-year improvement.

## 3. Spending–Outcome Correlations

**Infant mortality correlations** (negative values indicate that higher spending growth aligns with lower mortality):
- Rwanda: about −0.49 (moderate negative)
- South Africa: about −0.49 (moderate negative)
- Sweden: about 0.07 (no meaningful relationship in annual changes)

**Life expectancy correlations** (positive values would indicate that higher spending growth aligns with higher life expectancy in the same year):
- Rwanda: about −0.54 (moderate negative)
- South Africa: about −0.43 (moderate negative)
- Sweden: about 0.09 (no meaningful relationship)

**Interpretation:**
Negative correlations for life expectancy in Rwanda and South Africa likely reflect timing effects, measurement noise, or reallocation toward lagging areas that do not shift the year's headline metric immediately. Sweden's near-zero correlations are consistent with saturation at high outcome levels.

## 4. Efficiency Comparison

**Efficiency index, directionally summarized**  
(higher positive values indicate greater improvement per unit increase in spending):
- **Infant mortality efficiency.** South Africa shows a small positive effect. Rwanda's index is negative in the constructed measure despite large absolute declines, which suggests high cost per marginal reduction in certain years or sensitivity to base effects. Sweden is near zero, which is consistent with its very low baseline mortality.
- **Life expectancy efficiency.** Rwanda is strongest. South Africa is slightly negative. Sweden is near zero with little movement.

**Interpretation:**
Rwanda's efficiency for life expectancy suggests that targeted investment and scale-up of essential services can produce substantial gains even when annual spending–outcome correlations are noisy. South Africa's mixed profile suggests uneven returns across metrics and the influence of disease burdens and service bottlenecks. Sweden illustrates the diminishing returns in mature systems.

# Policy Implications

**For developing systems (Rwanda, South Africa)**
- Sustain multi-year investment rather than rely on one-off spikes. Predictable funding improves programme execution and outcome momentum.
- Target high-impact interventions, including maternity and neonatal care, infectious disease control and primary prevention for non-communicable diseases.
- Monitor efficiency by metric. If life expectancy gains outpace infant mortality reductions, shift marginal resources toward neonatal and maternal health or other bottlenecks.

**For mature systems (Sweden)**
- Focus on prevention, chronic disease management and delivery innovation. Large spending increases are unlikely to move headline outcomes appreciably from year to year.
- Set cost benchmarks and monitor equity of access. When outcomes plateau, shift attention to efficiency and equal access.

# Limitations

- Small sample size limits generalizability. Future research could include a broader set of countries, either from diverse global contexts or with similar socio-economic profiles within the same region.
- Correlation does not imply causation. Annual changes can mask lags between spending and outcomes.
- External shocks are not identified or specifically accounted for in the analysis.
- Donor dependence can distort trajectories. Rwanda's early spending surge likely reflects aid cycles that do not always persist.

# Conclusion

Efficiency in health spending depends on the stage of development and investment quality. Rwanda demonstrates that targeted investment can deliver large life expectancy gains from a low base, even when infant mortality efficiency is harder to sustain. South Africa's mixed record points to the value of persistent reforms aligned with disease burden and service delivery gaps. Sweden illustrates that at advanced development levels, maintenance, innovation and equity matter more than marginal spending increases. The key lesson is that outcomes improve most when resources are directed where they have the highest marginal effect and when funding is consistent over time.
